### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi my name is Charlton, I am currently in my second of 3 year degree apprenticeship with QA & Roehampton University, UK.

I have mainly used C# to program, but currently in the process of learning Python.

In my spare time I run a basketball team, spends time with my family and play fighting games.
